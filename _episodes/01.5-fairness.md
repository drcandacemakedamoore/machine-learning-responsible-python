## Seeing differt kinds of fairness

It has been suggested that computer programs can potentially be more fair than humans. But how can we define and approach fairness, let alone ethics?

Let's tackle a practical and still ongoingproblem with a computer program. Medical schools in the Netherlands are [not known to be particularly diverse, and people are looking for solutions](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/208903085/Selection_for_health_professions_education_leads_to_increased_inequality_of_opportunity_and_decreased_student_diversity_in_The_Netherlands_but_lottery_is_no_solution_A_retrospective_multi_cohort_study.pdf) as the linked research highlights. 


## 
Exercise 1: you are given a pandas dataframe of potential medical students.Create an algorithm that is fair to help with admissions in pairs.

Name your algorithm, Show your algorithm to the group, and explain why this is the fairest approach.

Exercise 2: rate the algorithms in terms of

1. Conditional probability fairness
2. Demographic parity
3. Ease of human oversight
4. Explainability
5. Other unmentioned ethical/fairness issues
